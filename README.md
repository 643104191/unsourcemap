UnSourceMap - Deobfuscate JavaScript code with source maps
==========================================================

`unsourcemap` will deobfuscate minified code using
[source maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/).
Source maps map compiled code back to the original code, including
mangled to original function and variable
names.

## Usage

This is an **extremely rough cut** by someone who doesn't know nodejs.

I don't even know how this works yet.

```
usage: unsourcemap.js <path-to-js> <path-to-source-map> <output-dir>
```
